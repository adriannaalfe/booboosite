        Brutus, now more commonly referred to as BooBoo, is an eight-year-old maltese. He was born in Arizona, on December 9th, 2007, and later ventured across the country to the eastern state of New Jersey. He didn't know it then, but his whole life was about to change drastically.
      </p>
      <p>
        When BooBoo arrived in New Jersey, he found himself at a pet store. This is where a family by the last name of Alfe would soon find him and fall in love. They brought him home with them, and thus, he began his new life with his new family.
      </p>
      <p>
        BooBoo now lives in Vineland, New Jersey, with his family, and his best buddy, Gizmo the Shih-Tzu. In his spare time, BooBoo enjoys, giving kisses, ripping up chew toys, barking at the window, hiding his toys in the most obscure places, and taking naps. He is most known for his superb break dancing skills and biting the butts of anyone who steps foot in his house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although BooBoo is little, weighing a measly nine pounds, he does not realize how small he is, and is absolutely a force to be reckoned with.
